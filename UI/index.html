        <h2>About the AvianAI Project</h2>
        <p>
          The AvianAI project is a machine learning project that uses AI to identify different species of birds. Our team has trained a deep neural network to recognize various bird species based on their unique features, such as their size, color, beak shape, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to help bird enthusiasts and researchers easily identify different bird species in the wild. With the AvianAI app, users can simply take a photo of a bird and our AI algorithm will identify the species in seconds.

        <h2>How AvianAI Works</h2>
        <p>
          The AvianAI algorithm is trained on a large dataset of bird images with labeled species information. We use transfer learning techniques to fine-tune a pre-trained model, enabling our algorithm to recognize bird species with high accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our app uses the device's camera to capture an image of a bird. The image is then sent to our server where the algorithm processes the image and returns the identified bird species to the app. The whole process takes only a few seconds.
